The deal comes less than a year after<i>Newsweek</i>transitioned from its 80-year-old classic print format to<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/18/3520544/newsweek-all-digital-publication">an all-digital model</a>; the<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/23/3797970/newsweek-ends-its-80-year-print-run-with-a-hashtagged-cover">final print issue</a>ran on December 31st, 2012, with a dramatic cover containing the hashtag "#LastPrintIssue." While<i>Newsweek</i>is part of a joint venture with sister site<i>The Daily Beast</i>, the<i>Beast</i>will not be included in the sale.<a target="_blank" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/peterlauria/barry-dillers-newsweek-experiment-is-over"><i>BuzzFeed</i>reports</a>that<i>The Daily Beast</i>will continue to be run under Diller's IAC by Tina Brown. The terms of the deal have not been made public.</p> <p>The sale doesn't come as a huge surprise based on<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/29/4282976/watch-this-barry-diller-on-aereos-future-and-why-buying-newsweek-was">ominous comments</a>from former owner Barry Diller, who is perhaps currently best known for causing headaches in the broadcasting world<a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/aereo">with Aereo</a>. In April, Diller expressed regret for purchasing<i>Newsweek</i>, calling the acquisition a mistake. "Printing a single magazine is a fool's errand if that magazine is a newsweekly," Diller said. "I don't have high expectations."</p> <p><i>Newsweek</i>will be operated as a subsidiary of IBT, and will return to its own domain "in the coming weeks."</p> <div class="article-meta clearfix"><ul class="simplelist sourcelist clearfix"> <li class="via clearfix"> <strong>Via</strong><span><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/peterlauria/barry-dillers-newsweek-experiment-is-over">buzzfeed</a></span> </li> <li class="source clearfix"> <strong>Source</strong><span><a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibt-media-to-acquire-newsweek-218235561.html">IBT Media</a></span> </li> <li class="tags clearfix"> <strong>Related Items</strong><span><a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/media">media</a><a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/magazine">magazine</a><a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/news-media">news media</a><a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/iac">iac</a><a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/barry-diller">barry diller</a><a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/newsweek">newsweek</a><a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/ibt">ibt</a><a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/international-business-times">international business times</a></span> </li> </ul></div> </div>"}
