{"title":"See the sights of Tokyo in this 150-gigapixel panorama", "author":"Aaron Souppouris", "content":"<p>If you've spent any length of time on the internet, chances are you've seen a multi-gigapixel image before. Giant composite photographs, often made up of thousands upon thousands of individual high-resolution shots, have documented an early mechanical computer, President Obama's inauguration, a zebrafish embryo, and even the surface of Mars. This latest shot, created by 360 Cities founder Jeffery Martin, gives a highly-detailed view of Tokyo from the observation deck of Tokyo Tower.</p> <p>The 150-gigapixel panorama was created from 10,000 individual photos captured using Martin's Canon EOS 7D DSLR camera and an Clauss Rodeon panorama head. It took two days to shoot all the necessary photographs, and twelve weeks to stitch together the panorama using an ultra-high power computer. According to 360 cities, a printed version of the panorama would be 328 feet long and 164 feet tall â€” almost the same size as a football field. You can explore the shot in the viewer above, but for a full-resolution version, and an additional 45-gigapixel image, head to 360 Cities.</p>"}
